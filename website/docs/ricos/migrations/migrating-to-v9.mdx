## Gallery

`wix-rich-content-plugin-gallery` is now uses pro-gallery `v4` (instead of `v3`).
Make sure all resolutions are cleaned up, and remove any dependency of pro-gallery v3

## Image

The `wix-rich-content-plugin-image` uses `@wix/image` instead of Ricos custom image implementation to bring rich content image performance to wix's standard and cleanup the custom Ricos image for lighter bundle
